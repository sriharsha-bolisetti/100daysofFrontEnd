###### Height Algorithms
- Default `height` behaviour is to be as `small` as possible while fitting all of the element's content
###### Margin Collapse
- Only Vertical Margin Collapse
- Margins only collapse in flow layout
- Only adjacent margins collapse
- The bigger margin wins
- Nesting doesn't prevent collapsing.
- Margins must be touching in order for them to collapse.
- Margins can collapse in the same direction
- More than two margins can collapse
